# TutorialEdge.net

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elliotforbes/tutorialedge-v2.svg?branch=master)

I've been working on TutorialEdge.net as a hobby project since early 2015. Since then it's gone from only a handful of visitors per day to something that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors per year. 

The main aim for the site is for it to be a place that I can host tutorials and courses on any language and framework I choose and hopefully give back something to the programming community.
